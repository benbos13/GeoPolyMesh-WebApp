This WebApp allows to create, edit and validate XML input files for GeoPolyMesh (https://github.com/AlexandreMARIN/GeoPolyMesh).

It is made to be the most flexible and minimalist XML editor possible.
It uses a system of JSON configuration file allowing for a deep XML validation by checking :
  - The XML tags.
  - The tag arguments (name, value type and value range if any).
  - The XML file structure.

It relies on four main classes that you can understand by reading a JSON configuration file :
  - Tag         Contains all the information about a tag.
  - Argument    Contains all the information about a tag argument.
  - Node        Contains all the information about a node in the XML tree structure.
  - Enum        Allow to create exclusive choices for a node.


Usage :
    node . [-h|--help|help] [-v|--version] <command> [<args>]

Note that only some commands are mutually exclusive (read/write).
Meaning that you can use multiple commands at once.

Commands :
    -h, --help, help    Displays this message.
    -v, --version       Displays the version numbers.

    -r, read            Reads an XML file and create a JSON that can be used by GPMWeb.
                        Argument : The XML file path.

    -w, write           Writes a JSON (usually generated by GPMWeb) into an XML file.
                        Argument : The JSON file path.

    -o, output          Changes the path and name of any outputed file (default is input file name and path).
                        Argument : The wanted path and name.

    -c, configure       Loads or overloads in a JSON configuration file.
                        Argument : The JSON configuration file path.
                        Note : The loaded configuration will not change even on terminal death.

    -d, discard         Discard the loaded configuration file.
